# Automate The Boring Stuff With Python Files
This is a repository with the programs and solutions I've created as I work my way through Automate The Boring Stuff With Python.

It is organized by chapter and I put all the python solutions or programs I create in each chapter's folders.
I'll update this as I go and get better at coding, but initially most of this will be pretty ugly and bare-bones code.
